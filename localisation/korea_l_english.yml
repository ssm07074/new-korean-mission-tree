 kor_establish_hangul_title:0 "Hangul The Alphabet"
 kor_establish_hangul_desc:0 "Hangul is the Korean alphabet created in 1443 and promulgated in the 1446 work Huminjeongeum, or The Proper Sounds For the Instruction of the People. Sponsored by Sejong the Great and probably created by the Hall of Worthies, the new script was meant as a replacement for the Chinese characters used in Korea at the time, which was inefficient for expressing the Korean language. They were made easy, so that even a commoner could learn to read and write them. A wise man can acquaint himself with them before the morning is over. A stupid man in the space of ten days.\"\n\nThis would eventually lead to such a high literacy rate among those of lower birth that a paranoid king banned the use of Hangul in 1504. However, use did not stop entirely, and in the late 16th century Hangul saw a revival and quickly became the dominant alphabet in Korea."
