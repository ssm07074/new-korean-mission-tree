 kor_establish_hangul_title: "Hangul The Alphabet"
 kor_establish_hangul_desc: "Hangul is the Korean alphabet created in 1443 and promulgated in the 1446 work \"Huminjeongeum\", or \"The Proper Sounds For the Instruction of the People.\"\n\nSponsored by Sejong the Great and probably created by the Hall of Worthies, the new script was meant as a replacement for the Chinese characters used in Korea at the time, which was inefficient for expressing the Korean language. They were made easy, so that even a commoner could learn to read and write them. \"A wise man can acquaint himself with them before the morning is over. A stupid man in the space of ten days.\"\n\nThis would eventually lead to such a high literacy rate among those of lower birth that a paranoid king banned the use of Hangul in 1504. However, use did not stop entirely, and in the late 16th century Hangul saw a revival and quickly became the dominant alphabet in Korea."

His uncle, and brother of the former king, Sejo, usurped his throne and seized the kingdom for himself. After a failed assassination attempt by ministers loyal to Danjong, Sejo had them and the former king killed.\n\nDespite his ruthlessness, or possibly because of his unstoppable daring, he was a successful ruler, centralising the country and encouraging the publication of books on history, economics and religion. He was also a great military strategist, and attacked the Jurchen tribes of the north multiple times. \n\nMost famously, in 1468 he established the first form of constitutional law in Korea, the Grand Code for State Administration."
